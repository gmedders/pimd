Ising model
===========

 - This project contains a brute-force Monte Carlo approach to obtaining thermodynamic
 properties of the Ising model, as well as the
 [cluster Monte Carlo algorithm by Wolff](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.62.361).

How to build:
=============

 - git clone https://github.com/gmedders/pimd.git
 - cd pimd
 - mkdir build
 - cd build
 - cmake ..
 - cmake --build .
 - ctest -VV

To override your default C and C++ compilers, you can use the following instead (for example):
```
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc-8 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-8 ..
```

# Usage
To compile, run:
```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```

The workflow involves generating a set of initial conditions (positions, velocities, and electronic state IDs) consistent with a given temperature. This is done, for example, by `rpmd.cpp`

```
# usage: rpmd nbeads beta dt GammaEl gammaTh_factor voltage nsamples
./rpmd 1 1024 1.0 1.0E-3 2 0.0 2 > log.dat
```

which stores the requested initial conditions in the file `cart_traj-rpmd_1_1024.dat` and the simulation statistics in (e.g., potential and kinetic energy) in `log.dat`. In the command line input:
- `nbeads` is the number of beads in the ring-polymer molecular dynamics (1 bead corresponds to classical dynamics)
- `beta` is the inverse temperature (1024 is roughly 300 Kelvin)
- `dt` is the timestep
- `GammaEl` is the electronic coupling (see reference below)
- `gammaTh_factor` is a scaling factor the thermal friction for Langevin dynamics (the friction is defined as `gamma = gammaTh_factor * omega`, where omega is the harmonic frequency of the example potential)
- `voltage`, if non-zero, corresponds to CME dynamics with multiple electronic baths
- `nsamples` is the number of initial conditions requested

The time-dependent ensemble average is performed using `ensemble_tcf_rpmd.cpp`. This requires the initial conditions generated by `rpmd.cpp` and similar simulation parameters.

```
# usage: ensemble_tcf_rpmd input_file dt GammaEl gammaTh_fac voltage time
./ensemble_tcf_rpmd cart_traj-rpmd_1_1024.dat 1.0 1.0E-3 2.0 0.0 50000 > ens.dat
```

Several example potentials are available and can be selected in `tools/sim-classes.h`

Finally, as the codes were exploratory, they were not optimized for performance considerations.
